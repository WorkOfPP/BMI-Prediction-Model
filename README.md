# BMI-Prediction-Model
In this project, I have replicated the [paper](https://github.com/PreetikaParashar/BMI_Prediction_Model/blob/main/Face-to-BMI.pdf). The goal is:
- to beat the performance metrics provided in the paper
- to create a simple web API to predict a user's BMI in real-time using webcam input
- use one of the pre-trained image models (e.g. VGG Face), fine-tune with the provided data, and deploy via Streamlit
